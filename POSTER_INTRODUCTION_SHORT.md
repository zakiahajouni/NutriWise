## Introduction & Problem Statement

In today's digital age, finding recipes that match personal dietary preferences, available ingredients, and nutritional needs remains a significant challenge. Traditional recipe platforms offer generic suggestions that fail to account for individual constraints such as allergies, dietary restrictions, and ingredient availability. NutriWise addresses this gap by leveraging deep learning to provide intelligent, personalized recipe recommendations and generation. The system learns from user preferences and ingredient constraints to suggest existing recipes or generate new ones tailored to individual needs, transforming how people discover and create meals in their daily lives.
